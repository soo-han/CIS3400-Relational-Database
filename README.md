## Real Estate Residential Database

In this project, we created a relational database for a small real estate residential firm where we address the problem or opportunity for the business, the information needs, and list of entities required for the database. 

In the systems of analysis part, we created the E-R Diagram along with Set of Relations and relationship sentences.
We also went through normalization process where we ensure that each entity is normalized to the third normal form (3NF). 
In creating the database, we used MS Access as our tool and SQL to create tables, insert data, and create forms. 

This repository includes our final output of the process. 
The following is the background information for the business.

### Description of Business <a name="description"></a>
- We are a small residential real estate company that focuses on
leasing out apartment buildings.
- With this database, we will be able to identify which tenant lives
in which building as well as their lease information.
- Excel sheets are not meant to be a database. With our database,
it will eliminate the need of keeping track of multiple excel sheets
and keep the information in one centralized location. It will also
make it easier for the employees to know how much rent is paid
for what kind of apartment and how many apartments are still
vacant.

### Information Needs <a name="information"></a>
- To run a successful business you can't have information in
multiple places. With a database, this information can be tracked
and organized in one central location.
- To accurately identify which tenant rents out which apartment,
how much rent they pay and their lease information.
- Keep track of asset manager information such as what building
they are in charge of and contact information.
