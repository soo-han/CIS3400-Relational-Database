## Real Estate Residential Database

In this project, we created a relational database for a small real estate residential firm where we address the problem or opportunity for the business, the information needs, and list of entities required for the database. 

In the systems of analysis part, we created the E-R Diagram along with Set of Relations and relationship sentences.

We also went through normalization process where we ensure that each entity is normalized to the third normal form (3NF). 

This repository includes our final output of the process. 

The following is the background information for the business.
